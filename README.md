Note: In the current version of the analysis, the architecture with ID CTG23wd9H74, titled "Building an HPC Modeling Platform to Simplify AWS Usage for Scientists and Engineers", was classified as HPC. However, due to the presence of the CloudFront edge distribution service, its correct categorization should be HPC+Edge. This discrepancy does not significantly affect the overall results but is recorded here for accuracy and transparency purposes.
